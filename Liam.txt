this was my first time doing a game jam and it was set to be on the weekend were we had 48 hours to make a game. 
I was able to get a team of three for the game jam, and with this team we were able to work to gether and make 
a completed game by the times end. the game had a chalenge "You are the projectile" 
this inspired are game Not pong inspired by pong were insted of controling the pattles you control the ball.

this game jam gave me a lot of experince in what its like to work in a fast pace and stress full invirment with a team, 
aswell as lern a lot about Unity and C# as that is the softwaer and programs we used to make are game.
at the end of the 48 hours we were given the results were unfortunatly we did not win however we were also 
givin the opertunitie to talk to a persion in the indistry. the persion although I forget there name worked in
the media sector for CD Project Red, this is the company that made the populer game CyberPunk 2077. 
we were able to ask him quistions about the industry as well as lissin to advice he had for us.
I think that overall this was a very good experince for me both for networking as Game jams are a populer 
way for companys to find new developers, but also a way for me to lern and improve my skills in making games.
